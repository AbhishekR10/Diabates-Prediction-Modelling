# Diabetes Prediction Project

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. Whether you're a data scientist, healthcare professional, or machine learning enthusiast, you'll find valuable resources here to build and deploy predictive models for diabetes prediction.

## Introduction:

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing diabetes effectively. This project aims to develop machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age.

## Dataset:

The dataset used for this project contains information about several health-related features and whether the individual has diabetes or not. The features include glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, age, and more.

## Approach:

We have employed various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, XGBoost, and k-nearest neighbors to develop predictive models for diabetes prediction. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. We performed model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, mean absolute error, R-squared score, and mean squared error.

## Dependencies:

This project was developed using Python programming language and various libraries including:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Usage:

To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure you have all the dependencies installed. You can then explore the notebooks and scripts to understand the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation process.
