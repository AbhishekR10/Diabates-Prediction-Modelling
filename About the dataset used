Diabetes Prediction Modelling dataset:

Glucose Levels: Glucose appears to be a significant predictor of diabetes. Higher glucose levels are generally associated with a higher likelihood of diabetes. People with glucose levels above a certain threshold show a sharp increase in the outcome of diabetes.

Age Factor: Age is another important feature. Older individuals, especially those above the age of 45, seem to be more prone to developing diabetes, showing a positive correlation with the outcome variable.

BMI (Body Mass Index): A higher BMI indicates a higher risk of diabetes. Individuals classified as overweight or obese (BMI > 25) show a higher likelihood of having diabetes.

Pregnancies: Women with a higher number of pregnancies tend to show a slightly higher risk of developing diabetes. This might be due to factors related to gestational diabetes or other health complications from pregnancy.

Blood Pressure: While blood pressure might not have a very strong correlation, individuals with very high or very low blood pressure seem to be more likely to have diabetes, suggesting potential links to metabolic syndrome.

Insulin and Skin Thickness: These two features are more complex. While higher insulin levels often correlate with diabetes, missing or irregular insulin data can affect predictions. Skin thickness shows weak correlations, but it may relate to fat distribution, which indirectly connects to diabetes risk.

Diabetes Pedigree Function: This feature shows the genetic predisposition to diabetes. Individuals with a higher diabetes pedigree function are more likely to develop the disease, indicating a strong genetic influence.

To improve the predictive power of your Diabetes Prediction Modelling project, you could consider adding additional columns that capture other important factors linked to diabetes. Here are some potential columns you could add:

1. Family History of Diabetes:
A categorical variable indicating if immediate family members (parents, siblings) have a history of diabetes. This could further quantify the genetic risk.
2. Physical Activity Level:
A feature that captures the individualâ€™s physical activity (e.g., sedentary, moderate, or active). Sedentary lifestyles are linked to higher diabetes risk.
3. Dietary Habits:
Information about dietary habits, such as high sugar or high-fat diets, which are associated with increased diabetes risk.
4. Smoking Status:
A binary or categorical column indicating whether the individual is a smoker, non-smoker, or former smoker. Smoking is known to increase the risk of diabetes.
5. Alcohol Consumption:
Regular alcohol consumption levels (e.g., none, light, moderate, heavy) could be an important factor, as excessive alcohol intake can contribute to diabetes.
6. Cholesterol Levels:
Adding HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels can help, as people with diabetes often have abnormal lipid profiles.
7. Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR):
This ratio is a better indicator of central obesity, which is a risk factor for diabetes. Central obesity is more strongly linked to metabolic syndromes than BMI alone.
8. Stress Levels:
Stress is a factor that can influence glucose regulation. A self-reported stress level column could add another dimension to the risk factors.
9. Sleep Duration and Quality:
Poor sleep is linked to insulin resistance and higher diabetes risk. Tracking sleep habits can provide additional insights into diabetes risk.
10. Medication History:
A column indicating if the individual is on any medication (like antihypertensives or statins) could help, as certain medications can affect glucose levels or insulin sensitivity.
11. Socioeconomic Factors:
Factors like education level, income, or occupation type can provide insights, as lower socioeconomic status is often linked with higher diabetes prevalence.
12. Resting Heart Rate:
Elevated resting heart rates can indicate poor cardiovascular health, which is closely associated with metabolic disorders like diabetes.
13. Thyroid Function:
Thyroid disorders can affect metabolism and increase the risk of diabetes, so a thyroid function indicator could be a useful feature.
14. Chronic Conditions:
Other chronic conditions like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or liver disease could be considered as comorbidities that may affect diabetes outcomes.
