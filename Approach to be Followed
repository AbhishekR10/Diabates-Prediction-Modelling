The dataset used in this project contains various features related to diabetes, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. Here's a brief description of the dataset:
Features: The dataset includes several features that provide information about individuals' health and medical history. These features may include:

Age
Body mass index (BMI)
Blood pressure
Plasma glucose concentration
Serum insulin levels
Diabetes pedigree function
Number of pregnancies (for females)
And other relevant health metrics.
Target Variable: The target variable indicates whether an individual has diabetes or not. It is typically binary, with values representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.
Observations: Each row in the dataset represents data collected from a single individual. The dataset may contain information from a diverse population, including individuals with and without diabetes.
Missing Values: The dataset may contain missing or incomplete values for some features. Handling missing values appropriately during data preprocessing is essential to ensure accurate model training and evaluation.
Data Integrity: It's crucial to ensure the integrity of the data by checking for outliers, inconsistencies, or errors that may affect the quality of the predictions. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques can help identify potential issues and guide data preprocessing steps.
